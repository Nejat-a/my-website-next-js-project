# My portfolio website - A Next.js project.

Couple of month ago, I designed my portfolio website which was written in pure HTML, CSS and JavaScript. Now, I desided to convert my website to Next.js, because I think Next.js websites are much easier to maintain because Next.js is component based language. For my future projects I will use React and Next.js in fronend because I enjoy those a lot. I used CSS styled components for styling the website.
